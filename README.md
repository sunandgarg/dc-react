# DekhoCampus React, Node, Prisma, and MySQL

The existing React/Vite frontend is preserved. Application data can now be routed to the Node/Prisma/MySQL backend in `backend/` by setting `VITE_USE_MYSQL=yes`, `VITE_USE_SUPABASE=no`, and `VITE_API_URL`.

For local setup and API details, see `backend/README.md`. For verified scope, unresolved production dependencies, and the exact cutover order, see `docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md`.

# Original project documentation

## Production hosting

The React frontend is deployed by **Cloudflare Pages** from GitHub. The backend
remains Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage, and the Edge Functions under
`supabase/functions`. Cloudflare serves the static Vite build; it does not
replace Supabase or require database credentials in the browser.

In Cloudflare Pages, connect the GitHub repository and use:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `dist` |

Set these Cloudflare Pages environment variables for **Production** and
**Preview** builds:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_...
```

`public/_redirects` provides the React Router fallback, so refreshing a route
such as `/auth` or `/college/example` works on Cloudflare Pages. The Cloudflare
Pages Function at `/api/blog-agent-cron` is available for authenticated manual
runs. The 30-minute schedule is the separate Worker in
`workers/blog-agent-scheduler`, because Cron Triggers run Workers rather than
Pages Functions. Deploy it once and set its secrets:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy --config workers/blog-agent-scheduler/wrangler.jsonc
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL --config workers/blog-agent-scheduler/wrangler.jsonc
npx wrangler secret put BLOG_AGENT_SECRET --config workers/blog-agent-scheduler/wrangler.jsonc
```

The Worker configuration declares `*/30 * * * *` in UTC. Do not use a
publishable key or service-role key as a Cloudflare frontend variable.

To provision a fresh Supabase project from this repository, authenticate the
Supabase CLI, then run the following from the repository root. This applies the
versioned database migrations and deploys every Edge Function. Configure any
third-party credentials as Supabase Edge Function secrets, never as Vite/Vercel
public variables.

```sh
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf
npx supabase db push
for fn in supabase/functions/*; do
  [ -d "$fn" ] && npx supabase functions deploy "$(basename "$fn")"
done
```

For Google sign-in, add the Cloudflare production URL, Pages preview URL, and
custom domain to Supabase Authentication → URL Configuration, then enable
Google in Authentication → Providers using its OAuth client credentials.

## Legacy content migration

`npm run import:static` imports the public pre-rendered college, course, exam,
and article data from the archived site. It deliberately excludes leads, user
accounts, passwords, and any other personal data. Existing Supabase slugs are
never overwritten: every collision is written to the JSON report.

Run a read-only audit first:

```sh
npm run import:static -- --content-root "/path/to/.next/server/pages" \
  --report reports/legacy-static-import-report.json
```

To import, use the **Supabase service-role key only in your local terminal**.
Do not put this key in Vercel, a browser `.env`, or GitHub. Imports are drafts
by default, so old admission and exam information must be reviewed before it
becomes public. Add `--publish` only after review. `--mirror-assets` downloads
only HTTPS files from the known legacy AWS/CloudFront hosts into Supabase
Storage; failed files retain their original public URL and are listed in the
report.

```sh
SUPABASE_URL="https://kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf.supabase.co" \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key" \
npm run import:static -- --content-root "/path/to/.next/server/pages" \
  --apply --mirror-assets --report reports/legacy-static-import-report.json
```

### 31-12-2024 CSV database

Use `import:legacy-csv` for the relational CSV export containing `colleges.csv`,
`course_info.csv`, `exams.csv`, `college_course.csv`, and the supporting public
content tables. The importer ignores users, accounts, leads, and other private
tables. It normalizes legacy fields such as `Estd 2010`, resolves duplicate
slugs, enriches existing rows without replacing curated content, and creates
deterministic course-fee IDs so reruns are safe.

Run the audit and produce Supabase-compatible manual fallback files:

```sh
npm run import:legacy-csv -- \
  --source-dir "/absolute/path/CSV Excel Database" \
  --export-dir reports/legacy-csv-mapped \
  --report reports/legacy-csv-import-report.json
```

For a direct import, explicitly provide the production project ref and its
matching secret/service-role key. The script refuses a mismatched URL and never
loads the frontend `.env` for privileged writes. New rows remain Draft unless
`--publish` is added.

```sh
export SUPABASE_URL="https://kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf.supabase.co"
read -rs "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY?Paste Supabase secret/service-role key: "
echo
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

npm run import:legacy-csv -- \
  --source-dir "/absolute/path/CSV Excel Database" \
  --apply --project-ref kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf \
  --report reports/legacy-csv-import-report.json
```

If Dashboard CSV import is required, import the generated files in this order:
`courses.csv`, `exams.csv`, `colleges.csv`, then `course_fees.csv`.

Use `--skip-existing` for a fast recovery run after a network interruption. It
inserts only missing slugs and leaves every successful row untouched.

### Legacy image migration to WebP

`migrate:legacy-assets` inventories legacy AWS/CloudFront image references in
colleges, courses, exams and articles. With `--apply`, it downloads each unique
image once, normalizes orientation, limits it to 1920×1920, converts it to WebP,
uploads it to the public `legacy-public-assets` Supabase Storage bucket, verifies
the uploaded object, and only then replaces the database reference. Failed
downloads keep their old URL. Content-addressed object names and database-first
inventory make reruns safe and resumable.

Run inventory first:

```sh
npm run migrate:legacy-assets -- \
  --project-ref kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf \
  --report reports/legacy-asset-inventory.json
```

Apply in controlled batches after reviewing the inventory and Supabase File
Storage allowance:

```sh
npm run migrate:legacy-assets -- \
  --project-ref kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf \
  --apply --limit 500 --concurrency 6 --quality 82 \
  --report reports/legacy-asset-migration-report.json
```

Rerun the same controlled batch command until inventory reaches zero. Use
`--all` only when deliberately scheduling every remaining object in one run.

The command requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the local
terminal. The key must never be committed or exposed to browser code.

### Collegedunia watermark sanitization

`sanitize:collegedunia` removes the bottom 12% from every referenced legacy
public-bucket image. It covers all current string and string-array image fields,
including college galleries, course/exam images, logos, articles, careers,
faculty, promotional content, and study resources.

The sanitizer never overwrites or deletes an original. It writes a verified
WebP under `sanitized/bottom-12-v1/` and updates a database reference only after
the new object exists. New object URLs also prevent stale one-year browser/CDN
caches from continuing to serve the old watermarked image. Reruns are safe and
resume from the remaining unsanitized references.

Inventory first:

```sh
npm run sanitize:collegedunia -- \
  --project-ref kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf \
  --report reports/collegedunia-watermark-inventory.json
```

Apply in batches:

```sh
npm run sanitize:collegedunia -- \
  --project-ref kozdctbbvrnyddlftmvf \
  --apply --limit 500 --concurrency 8 \
  --report reports/collegedunia-watermark-sanitization.json
```

Repeat until inventory reports `unique_assets: 0`, or use `--all` for a
deliberate full run. The command requires `SUPABASE_URL` and
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
